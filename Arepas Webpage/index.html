    <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>Chef Ryan Pera, Coltivare Pizza & Garden, Houston, learned the art of arepas from his sister-in-law.
      <br> Now, this recipe is his easy Sunday meal of choice, packed with leftovers or farm-fresh produce.
      </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <p>For a serving of 4 people</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups arepa flour (precooked cornmeal)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Desired fillings (such as shredded cooked chicken or pork, stewed black beans
          <br>with cheese and lime, corn salad with onion and fresh herbs; for serving)</li>
        <li>Lime wedges (for serving)</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients Info:</h2>
      <p>Arepa flour is precooked corn flour, not to be confused with masa harina.
      <br>Sometimes sold as masarepa or harina precocida, it can be found in Latin markets and some supermarkets.</p>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine arepa flour and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center and add 2½ cups warm water.</li>
        <li>Using a wooden spoon, gradually incorporate dry ingredients, stirring until no dry lumps remain. Let rest 5 minutes to hydrate.</li>
        <li>Knead dough a few times in bowl, then divide into 8 pieces. Roll each piece on work surface into a ball, then gently flatten to about ½” thick.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 4 arepas, cover, and cook until golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Uncover, flip, and cook (keep uncovered) until other side is golden brown, 6–8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer arepas to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and dough.</li>
        <li>Split arepas and stuff with desired fillings; serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.</li>
      </ol>
